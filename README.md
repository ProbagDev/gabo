# G.A.B.O
Gear and Build Organizer. Basically just a glorified search engine for gear to hopefully help with building a character.

## Live Version
https://probagdev.github.io/gabo/

## Usage
- Enter your API Key
- Choose your Character
- Click a piece of gear you want to replace
- Choose your rarity, weapon type where applicable, and stat to filter results

Gear across your entire account will be shown in the results that matches your filters. They are divided into categories.
#### _Matches_
    Matches are hits that fill all criteria

#### _Superior_
    Superior gear matches the stats, but is of higher rarity than requested

#### _Inferior_
    Gear that matches the stats, but is of lower quality than requested

#### _Convertable_
    Gear that can be thrown into the mystic forge to change stats

## Bug Reports
While you can email probagdev@gmail.com, it would be faster and more visible to create an issue on this repository.
To do this, navigate to the Issues tab above, give the bug a title and a description. Be thorough with your description. 
What did you expect to see, what steps did you take to get there, etc.

## Feature Requests
Please create an issue using the same steps as you would a bug report. Try to format it in such a way that a developer knows 
what kind of user you are and how the feature would benefit you. For instance...

"I am a GW2 fashion enthusiast and I would like a way to hide all items that already have skins"

## Development
If you would like to fix a bug or add a feature yourself, you should be familiar with version control and github. The steps are generally as follows: 
- Fork the repository
- Create a feature branch on your fork off of the 'develop' branch
- Develop the feature
- Create a pull request from your feature branch into this repositories 'develop branch'

MIT License, baby. If you want to take all this work and run with it on your own site, feel free. Please just leave credit. It can be as simple as a note embedded in one of your main js scripts saying "Project based on https://github.com/ProbagDev/gabo"
